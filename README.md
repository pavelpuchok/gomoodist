# gomoodist
It's a simple desktop app to play ambient sounds. Inspired by [remvze/moodist](https://github.com/remvze/moodist), but made with Go and with the additional feature of easing sounds when pausing and disabling sound.

As I said, it's a simple app, so there are no features like a fancy-looking UI or Pomodoro or sleep timers. Just a basic UI page with sliders for configuring sounds.
